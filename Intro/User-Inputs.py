#*1* Comments and the input function
    #The input function allows the program to ask the user for information
    #User input is paramount, your address, credit card, and buttons you press on a controller are all inputs

a = input("What is your name?")
#a = 'cats and dogs'
# meow
print("Well hello there," + a)

###Before you run, write what you think this will print out?
###Run it, is that what happened?
###What must the '#' character do? 
###What happens if you take out the # before a = 'cats and dogs'? Why?

#*2* Data type of the input function
    #The input function always returns a string

# length_of_square = input("What is the length of one side your square?")
# area_of_square = length_of_square * length_of_square

###Before you run it, what will happen as a result?
###Run it, why was this the result?
###Below, rewrite the program that it won't error and will print the area of the square
# length_of_square = input("What is the length of one side your square?")
# area_of_square = length_of_square * length_of_square

#*# Activity #*#
#Make a new python file named genie.py
#In that file, write a program that asks the user for three different wishes
#Then prints out a sentence explaining each thing asked for in order
#Then prints out a sentence explaininng each thing where the first wish is listed second, second listed third, and third listed first
