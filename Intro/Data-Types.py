# *1*. "Printing" data to the console
#     printing means it will write the value to the terminal
#     We will start by just having it repeat what we say 
#     Printing is valuable in development and debugging because we can monitor a value over TimeoutError

print("Hawk Yeah")
#What do you notice about how this is structured?
#Can you change it to Go Hawks ?

# *2*. Assigning a value to a variable
#     Variables are used constantly in programming
#     Assigning a value to it means, the next time the variable is used, that will be its value 
#     Unlike math, variables can be strings (letters), numbers, decimal numbers, and more!

n = 17
pi = 3.1415926535897932
message = "And now for something... completely different!"

#Add code needed to print each variable after they're assigned
#Before you run your code, predict what will be printed
#List each variable assigned above:
#   1.
#   2.
#   3.
#List each assignment above:
#   1.
#   2.
#   3.

#*3*. Variable naming
    # There are very few rules when making a variable name 
    # But there are some!
    # (1) Cannot start with a number
    # (2) Cannot use special characters
    # (3) Cannot use a reserved keyword

#Write an example of a variable name which fails each condition
#   1.
#   2.
#   3.

    # Variable names also follow a specific naming standard
    # (1) camelCaseExample
    # (2) snake_case_example

###Write these three examples in each case:
#   1. letter index tracker
#   2. current time
#   3. index
#camel case
#   1.
#   2.
#   3.
#snake case
#   1.
#   2.
#   3.

#*4*. Data Types and Concatenation
    # '+' signs commonly mean add
    # However, variables can have different data types
    # Depending on the data type, + means something different!

# print('1' + '1')
###What will be printed out as a result of running the line of code above?
###What was the actual result? Why is this the result?

# print('We are number ' + 1)
###What kind of error will result when running the above line of code?
###Below, try casting the integer value so the line works as expected:
# print('We are number ' + 1)
###Below, use pythonic printing to print the message without an explicit cast
# print('We are number ' + 1)

#*# Activities #*#
#1. Below each line, predict what will be output, then run it and say if it was right or not
# print('1')
# print(1)
# print(1 + 2)
# print('1' + '2')
# print('Peanut Butter and ' + 'Jelly')
# print('This' , 'is' , 'a' , 'sentence')

#2. Using the animal variable, write two more print lines describing it. Then change it from dogs to cats
# animal = 'dogs'
# print(animal + ' are really cool.')

#3. Four Fours (use four fours in an equation to get 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4)
# print('Zero: ', 44-44)
# print('One: ')
# print('Two: ')
# print('Three: ')
# print('Four: ')
