import datetime

#Make a function based on the following contract:
#Name: timer
#Purpose: record the time difference between a user hitting enter
#Input: none
#Output: time it took


#write a program that:
#tells a user how quickly they pressed enter
#tells a user they are fast if it is under 100 milliseconds and slow if above (if exactly 50, call them a wizard!)
