//Create a function following this contract:
//Name: avg
//Purpose: Find the average of an array of numbers
//Input: a array of numbers
//Output: the average of those numbers


//Create a function following this contract:
//Name: stdev
//Purpose: Find the standard deviation of a list of numbers
//Input: a array of numbers
//Output: the standard deviation of those numbers


//Create a program that:
//Creates an array of 1000 random numbers between 1 and 50
//Calculate and print the average of those numbers
//Calculate and print the standard deviation of those numbers



//Once done, answer the following questions:
//1. How might you change how you generated your list to get an average close to 40?
//2. How might you change how you generated your list to reduce the standard deviation?
