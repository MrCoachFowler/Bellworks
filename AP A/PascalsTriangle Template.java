    //Name: createCoefficientArrayList
    //Purpose: stores an arraylist of cofficients for the triangle as an attribute
    //Input: void

    //Make a method following the contract
    //Name: printCoefficients
    //Purpose: prints out the coefficients of a pascals triangle
    //Input: void
    //Output: void
 
    //write a run program that:
    //prints out a pascals triangle to the 4th exponent
    //prints out a pascals triangle to the 8th exponent
    //prints out a pascals triangle to the 15th exponent

    //challenge: color all the odd numbers red
